✅ Objective:
To explore and apply Python’s core data structures that store, manage, and organize data in different formats suitable for various applications.

🔍 Activities Performed:
Learned about lists for storing sequences of mutable items and modifying them using methods like append, remove, etc.

Studied tuples, which are similar to lists but immutable, ideal for fixed data sets.

Implemented dictionaries to store data in key-value pairs, enhancing quick lookups and structured representation.

Explored sets to manage unique items and perform union/intersection operations.

🖥️ Output Observation:
Each data structure behaved according to its properties. The output highlighted differences between mutable and immutable types, and how unordered sets/dictionaries operate.

💡 Key Concepts Learned:
Lists are ideal for ordered, editable collections.

Tuples provide a way to secure data from changes.

Dictionaries are powerful for structured and mapped data, similar to databases.

Sets ensure uniqueness and support mathematical operations.

🧠 Reflections:
This was the most enriching week in terms of technical learning. These data structures form the backbone of efficient and scalable programming. The understanding of when and how to use each structure builds problem-solving skills that are crucial in real-world scenarios.
